The solution to this paradox lies in the fact that, although the tortoise continues to cover some distance, these distances become smaller and smaller.
And even though the number of these segments is infinite, they have a limit—a definite boundary, a destination.
This means that the sum of these infinitely many segments is finite and can be represented by a real number—the distance the tortoise will cover during the time we observe it.
And, of course, for Achilles, it is trivial to cover this finite distance.
