The ancient Greeks were masters of logic. Their mathematical proofs were elegant and beautiful. However, at times, they were undone by their own methods.
One example of this is found in the famous paradoxes of Zeno, the ancient Greek philosopher. Let's consider one of them:

Achilles is in a footrace with a tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example.
Suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed, one faster than the other.
After some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point.
During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say 2 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance,
by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead.
Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.
