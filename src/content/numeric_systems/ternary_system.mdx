It is a very ambitious task to make a device that can work in a 
numerical system with an irrational base($e=2.718281...$). But we can see that $e$ is closer to 3 than 2.
It is intuitively clear that design a computer working in a ternary numerical system is more difficult than 
in a binary one. But what if the game is worth the candle ?

A balanced(symmetrical) ternary numerical system (in which we use $-1, 0, 1$ instead of $0, 1, 2$) 
in a computer can provide some non-obvious advantages, such as: 
- ternary logic, where in addition to the usual values ​$True$ and $False$ we can use third as $Null$ for 
uncertainty(it is not an rare case in programming)
- more efficient calcus with negative numbers

There have been attempts to create such computers. 
There is the Soviet computer called "Сетунь" developed in 1959. 
It used thernary logic. And this was a serial model used at Universities. 
56 copies were created in Kazan computers factory.
