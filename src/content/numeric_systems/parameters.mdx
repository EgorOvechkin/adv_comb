There are some parameters of numerical systems. 
For example, the number of divisors of the base affects the divisibility of numbers in this system. 
So the duodecimal system may be preferable to the decimal one, because 12 has more integer divisors than 10
(_Maybe that's why the elves used it_). 
For machines, important factors are the simplicity of mathematical operations and what is called 
The efficiency(density) of the numerical system. 
Let's consider the latter.
