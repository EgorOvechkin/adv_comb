A human can use pen and paper, a large number of symbols and any configurations of them to calculate. 
We can even display operations with numbers graphically(like Kaktovik numerals).  
But computers need a different way to fix numbers. For example, we can consider a simple counter.
Each wheel in this device can be in ten states. If we want the counter to work with a different base = $k$,
we need a wheel with $k$ states.

Radio electronic devices usually have two stable states. 
A semiconductor(and previously a vacuum tube or punch card) can be in two states: open and closed. 
It passes electric current or not.  
So the binary system is natural for modern computers in some sense.
But is it the best?
